<h1>Linq</h1>

IEnumerable Implementation for JavaScript. I based this on 
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.linq.enumerable_methods(v=vs.110).aspx">Microsoft's IEnunermable documentation</a>.
I've found this really handy when doing back-end programming in C# and decided I'd like something like this for JavaScript. 
It doesn't use C#'s implemetation of lambda functions so developers still need to have some understanding of JavaScript's 
functions.
